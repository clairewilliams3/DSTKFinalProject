# Introduction to the data

This data is a duplicated version of data from the REMBRANDT study, which is a study with 3 sites (Pittsburgh, Nashville, and Chicago) with the aim of better understanding recurrent depression in older adults.

Each patient participates in activity sessions every 8 months for two weeks. They wear a Fitbit during the session, for 4 sessions total.  For the plot I produced, we examined mean heart rate across sessions and indicated when relapses occurred.  

# Here is my spaghetti plot

```{r}
library(knitr)
path <- here::here("output/spagplot.png")
include_graphics(path)
```

As you can see, patients were in one of three categories: healthy controls, no relapse, or relapsed.  Patients in the no relapse or relapse groups have history of late life depression, and relapses are indicated by red x's.
